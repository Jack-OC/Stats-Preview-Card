### What I learned

This was another useful challenge to become more comfortable with designing webpages using HTML and CSS. This was a fairly simple challenge, the only issue was putting an overlay on the image. To do this is I used mix-blend-mode multiply to blend the image into its parent object which had its background colour set to soft violet.
